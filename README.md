# $Sonar Object Classification Using Logistic Regression
<b>Overview</b><br>

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal returns. Using the Sonar Dataset, which contains 60 features representing sonar signal intensities at various angles, the goal is to develop a robust logistic regression model. The model aims to accurately distinguish between rocks and mines, with potential applications in underwater exploration and submarine detection. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results to ensure the model's effectiveness.
